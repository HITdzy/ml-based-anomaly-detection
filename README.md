Anomaly Detection by Machine Learning

## Introduction
The algorithm is based on the following paper

* Spectral Residuals

Hansheng Ren, Bixiong Xu, Yujing Wang, Chao Yi, Congrui Huang, Xiaoyu Kou, Tony Xing, Mao Yang, Jie Tong, Qi Zhang. Time-Series Anomaly Detection Service at Microsoft." 
arXiv preprint [arXiv:1906.03821](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03821) (2019).


## Examples
Example jupyter notebooks are located [here](https://github.com/yoshinaga0106/sr/tree/master/notebook)


## Installation
```bash
$ pip install sranodec
```

## Notes
I will also add SR-CNN and other methods.
